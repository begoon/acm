<H2>Preliminary Electronic Contest</H2>

<p>
Welcome to the testing round of the 11th BME International 24-hour Programming
Contest!

<p>
This document is the problem set for the Preliminary Electronic Contest to be
held on February 12th, 2011.

<p>
The PreEC provides a way for teams to familiarize themselves with our submission
system and the general atmosphere of the competition.  Whether teams participate
in this testing round or not, or whatever results they achieve, will not have
any consequences later in the competition.

<p>
The four problems we selected for the PreEC may not be the kind of problems you
would consider especially challenging, however they provide some clues about the
Electronic Contest - the required tools, the usage of our submission system and
so on.


<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>
The Preliminary Electronic Contest contains four problems. You have all the time
in the world to solve them, but we take submissions from 9:00 to 21:00 CET.
The inputs of the problems can be found in a zip file that you have probably
already downloaded from the website. Each problem will have exactly 10 test
cases.

<p>
You can use any platform or programming language to solve the problems. We are
interested only in the output files, you don't need to upload the source code
of the programs that solved them.  Once you are done, you can upload your
output files via the submission site:
<a href="http://ch24.org/sub/">http://ch24.org/sub</a>.
Your solutions will be evaluated on-line.

<p>
There are two major problem types:
<ul>
	<li>Non-scaled problems: problems that have an exact solution. When
	submissions to these are evaluated, a final score is given immediately.
	From one team, only one correct submission will be accepted for each input
	(since the input is either solved or not).  In the PreEC, P, R, and S are
	non-scaled problems.

	<li>Scaled problems: problems that do not have a known "best" solution.
	Outputs for these problems compete against each other, and scores are
	scaled according to the best uploaded output. A team may submit multiple
	correct submissions to one input (only the latest submission will be taken
	into consideration).  In the PreEC, only Q is a scaled problem.
</ul>

<p>
Note that points are awarded per output file and not per problem. If your
solution only works for some of the input files, you will still be awarded
points for the correct output files. A single output file however is either
correct or wrong - partially correct output files are not worth any points.

<h4>Additional information for non-scaled problems:</h4>

<p>
Be quick about uploading the output files, because the scores awarded for every
output file decrease with time. Uploading it just before the end of the contest
is worth <b>70%</b> of the maximum points achievable for the test case. During
the contest its value decreases linearly with time.  However you should also be
careful with uploading solutions. Uploading an incorrect solution is worth
<b>-5</b> points. This penalty is additive, if you upload more incorrect
solutions, you will receive it multiple times. For some problems, we
distinguish format errors (unparsable outputs) from incorrect outputs,
and the former will not be penalised.

<p>
Please note that there is no point in uploading another solution for an already
solved testcase because you cannot achieve more points with it. Therefore the
system will not register additional uploads for solved testcases.

<h4>Additional information for scaled problems:</h4>

<p>
In this case there will be no penalty for uploading a solution later, so you
are able to achieve the maximum amount of points by submitting in the very last
minute - if you beat the other teams' solutions, that is.

<p>
Scores to scaled problems are recalculated occasionally (every few minutes).
Your points may decrease in time (when another team submits a better solution
than yours).

<p>
Please be aware that only your last submission is considered - not your best one.

<p>
Good luck and have fun!


<h4>About the Submission site</h4>

<p>
The location of the submission site is:
<blockquote>
	<a href="http://ch24.org/sub/">http://ch24.org/sub</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
You will be able to log in to the submission site with your registered
team name and password. After login you can access three main views:


<h5>Team Status</h5>

<p>
You can see your team's status here, with all your submissions and the points
received for them.

<h5>Submit</h5>

<p>
This is where you can post your solution files. You can upload multiple
output files for multiple problems with a single submit.
The naming of the output files must strictly match the following format: X99.out
- where X is the problem's character code followed by a number (1 or 2 digits)
identifying the test case.

<h5>Scores</h5>

<p>
Here you can see the current standings of the contest. This will not be
available in the last hour.
